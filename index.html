      <p>The international language of the world has become code and computers are appearing in almost every aspect of our lives. Programming is how you can move from being a software user to being a creator and problem solver by writing  code. However, programming can be hard to get started on your own. So come join our workshop to find out how and why we program computers, and figure out how it can used in your projects and aspirations! </p>

<p>The workshop is targeted at beginners with no prior programming experience. If you are a math or engineering student, you likely will have too much experience for these workshops to benefit you. We will be covering an intense curriculum across three consecutive sessions and in the selection process will give priority to participants who can attend all three sessions.</p>

<p>Attendees are expected to bring their own laptops. We are able to provide
assistance to participants who do not have their own computer. During the first day of the workshop (Friday evening) we will help everyone install the necessary software on their computers.</p>

<p>We are affiliated with Women in Computer Science, and value a respectful, supportive and welcoming environment for all participants as described in our Code of Conduct. Everyone is welcome to apply for this workshop, though priority will be given to under-represented groups in the field of computing.</p>

<p>The workshop will cover an intense 14 hour curriculum designed to give beginners complete, basic programming skills to use in their studies or workplace. Over the course of the workshop, participants will learn the Python programming language through lectures and hands-on sessions, supported by a team of mentors.</p>

<p>This event has been made possible through funding received by the <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/">Python Software Foundation</a> and its Education and Outreach Committee, as well as <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/wics">Women in Computer Science</a>.

<p>On Friday we will help participants to install the software we will be using over the next two days and demonstrate how to run it to write simple Python commands. The goal is to have everyone up and ready for Saturday morning session.</p>

<p>On Saturday and Sunday we will have the interactive lecture from 10:00 to 12:00, followed by a provided lunch. After the lunch, starting at 1:00 PM we will have a two hour hands-on session. During the hands on sessions participants will work on a small project and will be supported by six mentors.</p>

<p>Mentors are helping to co-organize the event, teach curriculum and provide one-on-one assistance to participants. The low student to mentor ratio (5:1) will ensure that every student gets an opportunity to ask questions in person and gets individualized instruction during practical sessions. Mentors have been selected via an online application process.</p>
