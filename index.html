<a id="workshop-information" class="anchor" href="#workshop-information" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Workshop Information</h1>

<p>The workshop is targeted at <b>beginners with no prior programming
    experience</b>
or students in non-STEM fields. If you are a math or engineering student, you
likely will have too much experience for this workshop to benefit you. Everyone
is welcome to apply for this workshop, though preference will be given to
under-represented groups in the field of computing.</p>

<h3> What am I going to learn? </h3>
<p>The workshop will cover an intense 16 hour curriculum designed to give
beginners complete, basic programming skills to use in their studies or
workplace. The curriculum will cover basic programming concepts such as
variables, data-types, branching, loops, functions and usage of libraries for
simple numeric computations and plotting.  Over the course of the workshop,
participants will learn the Python programming language through lectures and
hands-on sessions, supported by a team of mentors.</p>

<h3> What do I need to bring? </h3>
<p>The joy of learning and lots of questions! Also, attendees are expected to bring
their own laptops. We might be able to provide assistance to participants who
do not have their own computer. During the first day of the workshop (Friday
evening) we will help everyone install the necessary software on their
computers.</p>

<h3> What is the format of the workshop? </h3>

<p> On Friday we will help participants to install the software we will be using
over the next two days and demonstrate how to run it to write simple Python
commands. The goal is to have everyone up and ready for Saturday morning
session.</p>

<p>On Saturday and Sunday we will have the interactive lecture from 10:00 to
12:00, followed by a provided lunch. After the lunch, starting at 1:00 PM we
will have a three hour hands-on session. During the hands on sessions
participants will work on a small project and will be supported by six
mentors.</p>

<p>Mentors are helping to co-organize the event, teach curriculum and provide
one-on-one assistance to participants. The low student to mentor ratio (5:1)
will ensure that every student gets an opportunity to ask questions in person
and gets individualized instruction during practical sessions. </p>

<h3> Who are we? </h3>
<p>Mentors and instructors are all grad students at the University of Waterloo.
We all enjoy programming and teaching others how to code. We are affiliated
with <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/wics">Women in Computer Science (WiCS) </a> and
value supportive, welcoming and beginner-friendly environment for all
participants. WiCS have successfully organized similar events in the past:

<ul>
    <li> November 2016: <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/events/programming-workshop-beginners"> Programming Workshop for Beginners </a></li>
    <li> January 2016: <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/events/python-workshop-beginners"> Python Workshop for Beginners </a></li>
    <li> September 2014: <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/events/python-workshops-beginners"> Python Workshops for Beginners </a> </li>
</ul>


<p> This is a FREE event that includes morning coffee and lunch. The funding for the event (coffee breaks and lunches) was provided by <a
    href="https://www.python.org/psf/about/" target="_new">Python Software Foundation</a> as well as <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/wics" target="_new">Women in Computer Science</a>. </p>
